# CS50-Game-of-15
This is a playable Game of 15 made in C as assigned by CS50x. You can play a game of any size from 3x3 to 9x9.

##Instructions
Run this game with an argument specifying the dimension of the grid, from 3 for 3x3 to 9 for 9x9.

##To-Do
I'm working on a God mode which will solve the puzzle, per the hacker version of the CS50x problem set. That code is commented out. I am not very good at Game-of-15, so visualizing the pathfinding algorithm has been difficult.
